# Hello ! I'm Ivan 

Computer engineering apprentice, I‚Äôm interested in software integration, embedded systems, signal processing, and critical environments.  
I pay great attention to code quality, automation (CI/CD), and mastering the development environment (containers, simulations, etc.).  
Currently studying at **CNAM Toulon**, I also work on personal and collaborative projects spanning AI, low-level programming, and web technologies.
